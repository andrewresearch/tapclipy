      "Firstly, this week was interesting and what I really liked about it was the picture game we played on monday.  I was the one who had the picture and I found it hard to communicate exactly what my drawing was, which showed me just how important communication is if you want to be successful.  It was a fun activity and it showed me some good first hand experience about how to communicate.  Secondly, we got back our memo assignment and I did pretty decent on it but definitely need to rewrite it and work on my memo writing overall.  I need to work on cutting out the fat and my passive writing style, which I know is going to be hard to change but I feel like with a lot of practice I will be able to vastly improve in this area.  Lastly, we have started to gain a little progress on the team project and have come up with some ideas on how to go about researching our proposition.  With regards to my action plan I canâ€™t recall working on encouraging the heart within my group, so that is something I have to be more aware of when we are meeting and do my best to better myself in this area.  I do feel like I have began to form some sort of a relationship with my group members, but I still need to improve these relationships in order for it to feel like I have really developed long term friendships/relationships within my group.  This weekend my plan is to work on rewriting my memo and writing up my resume.  I had a good time in class this week and I am looking forward to what next week has in store for us.\n",

    "Firstly, this week was interesting and what I really liked about it was the picture game we played on monday.  I was the one who had the picture and I found it hard to communicate exactly what my drawing was, which showed me just how important communication is if you want to be successful.  It was a fun activity and it showed me some good first hand experience about how to communicate.  Secondly, we got back our memo assignment and I did pretty decent on it but definitely need to rewrite it and work on my memo writing overall.  I need to work on cutting out the fat and my passive writing style, which I know is going to be hard to change but I feel like with a lot of practice I will be able to vastly improve in this area.  Lastly, we have started to gain a little progress on the team project and have come up with some ideas on how to go about researching our proposition.  With regards to my action plan I canâ€™t recall working on encouraging the heart within my group, so that is something I have to be more aware of when we are meeting and do my best to better myself in this area.  I do feel like I have began to form some sort of a relationship with my group members, but I still need to improve these relationships in order for it to feel like I have really developed long term friendships/relationships within my group.  This weekend my plan is to work on rewriting my memo and writing up my resume.  I had a good time in class this week and I am looking forward to what next week has in store for us.\n",
